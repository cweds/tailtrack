2. Use "Add to Home Screen" option
3. App will launch fullscreen like a native app

## üèó Architecture

### Database Schema
```typescript
// Households table
households {
  id: serial primary key
  name: varchar
  inviteCode: varchar unique
  createdAt: timestamp
}

// Users table
users {
  id: serial primary key
  username: varchar unique
  email: varchar unique  
  password: varchar (hashed)
  householdId: integer (foreign key)
  createdAt: timestamp
}

// Activities table
activities {
  id: serial primary key
  userId: integer (foreign key)
  householdId: integer (foreign key)
  dogs: text[] (array of dog names)
  action: varchar ('Fed' | 'Let Out')
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

### State Management
- **TanStack Query** for server state and caching
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **Local state** for UI interactions and form handling
- **Client-side caching** with 5-second expiration for performance
- **Household-based data sharing** - Activities shared across family members in same household

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced API calls** to prevent rate limiting
- **Optimistic updates** for immediate UI feedback
- **Intelligent caching** with automatic invalidation
- **Lazy loading** for code splitting
- **Memoized components** to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
```css
--pup-pink: #FFD5DC to #FFC0CB     /* Primary gradient - header and action buttons */
--golden-tan: #F5E1C0 to #E6D2A0   /* Secondary gradient - user info bar */
--soft-blue: #D4EAF7 to #B3D9F2    /* Action button - "Let Out" activities */
--pup-green: #C8EBC5 to #B5E3B1    /* Success states */
--warning-gray: #e5e7eb             /* Status banner warning background */
```

### Visual Identity
